        Question="How will you authenticate me as a customer/provider?"
        Answer="Each customer should be provided with a username, password and shared key."

      <question
        id="1"
        Question="What's the shared key?"
        Answer="Shared key is the 3rd component of the customer's credentials (besides the username/password). It is used to provide additional security to the customer."

      <question
           id="2"
           Question="What's the secret key?"
          Answer="Secret key is just another synonym for shared key."

    />

      <question
     id="3"
     Question="What's the shared secret?"
     Answer="The shared secret is an expiring MD5 hash generated based on your api credentials (username, password and shared key) and the current time in UTC. Each key is valid for an hour. There is a grace period of 5 minutes at the top of the hour to allow for slight differences in server times."

    />

      <question
     id="4"
     Question="How to generate the shared secret?"
     Answer="The shared secret is a two-step hashing process. First, the customer's password is MD5-hashed and the first 10 characters are saved. The customer's username, shared key, CurrentHour, and hashed password from the first step are then concatenated with a colon and MD5-hashed. Please refer to the Authorization page for more technical details."

      <question
     id="5"
     Question="After generating the shared secret, what should I do next?"
     Answer="All HTTP requests made to Lightspeed GMI Offer Service API should be signed by sending a standard HTTP Authorization Header. The scheme should be set to 'LSR-DIGEST' and should include parameters for ApiUser and SharedSecret. Please refer to the Authorization page for more technical details."
    ShowInFAQPage="True"
    />

      <question
     id="6"
     Question="Should I send the Authorization header with every request?"
     Answer="Absolutely. The communication with the API is stateless. Remember the shared secret is an expiring hash, you need to re-generate it on every request or you can cache it for no more than 1 hour."

      <question
     id="7"
     Question="I am generating the shared secret correctly, however when I tried my first API to api/public/Attributes, I got a 2003 error: Provider Id {CUSTOMER} is not defined in the offer service. What did I miss?"
     Answer="Nothing. This should not happen but in case it did, it means your account is not properly configured in the offer service. You need to contact Lightspeed GMI support for quick resolution."

      <question
        id="0"
        Question="Why do I have 2 APIs for offers? What's the difference between LiveOffers and TestOffers?"
        Answer="Live offers are by default exposed publicly to all our customers. Test offers are not exposed to the public as Live offers, Test offers are only available for new customers for testing purposes. To summarize, LiveOffers is the official API that should be used by all our customers for production use while TestOffers API should be used only for testing purposes."

      <question
        id="1"
        Question="I want a general list of offers not associated with a panelist. What value am I supposed to pass for pid? "
        Answer="If you need a general list of offers, you can omit or remove the pid parameter from the URL. The offer service will know that you're asking for the general offers and return the corresponding list."
        ShowInFAQPage="True"
    />

      <question
  id="2"
  Question="I want to get the collection of offers for a specific country and language. What are their values and formats?  "
  Answer="The offer service provides a separate API for querying and looking up for all supported attributes along with their values and formats. Refer to the Attributes API for more information on how to use it."
  ShowInFAQPage="True"
    />

      <question
  id="3"
  Question="I am a bit confused. When should I pass the country and language parameters in the URL and when not to?"
  Answer="The country and language parameters are mandatory only when requesting offers for a specific respondent (in other words, when passing the pid parameter in the URL)."
